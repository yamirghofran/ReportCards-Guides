description: New Feature - Quantitative Criterion Parameters + A.I.
---

As of now, when you select "Quantitative" for a criterion type, you have the option to add "parameters". In each parameter, you can enter a minimum and maximum grade and a descriptor for that range. You can add 3 parameters for each quantitative criterion with the free plan and unlimited paramters with the pro plan. Later, when grading quantitative criteria, the artificial intelligence will generate a comment for the student based on the quantitative grade you enter based on the descriptors of the parameter that corresponds with the grade you enter.
