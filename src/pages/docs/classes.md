## Creating a New Class

You can create a new class by navigating to the "Classes" tab in the sidebar on the left, and clicking the "New Class" button.

### Name 
This will be the name of the class (e.g. Grade 12 IB) that will be in the report card.

### Subject

Here, you can select which subject is taught in the new class that you are creating. This will later make sure that you grade the students in this class based on the right criteria.

## Managing Students

You can either create a student in a class manually or import all of your students from an existing database (e.g. Renweb, Google Classroom, Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) by uploading a CSV (comma-separated-values) file. Simply refer to the database of your students and export to CSV, including students' first name, last name, and email separately in different columns. The order of the columns or how you name them won't matter because you will be prompted to select what type of value (first name, last name, and email) each column holds upon uploading the CSV file.

### Create Student Manually

To create a single student in your class manually, simply navigate to the class and click on the "New Student" button. You will then be prompted to enter the student's first name, last name, and email address. After entering those values, you can simply click the "Create Student" button and be automatically redirected to the class page. The new student should appear without you having to refresh the page.

### Import Students from a CSV File

You can also import all of your students by uploading a CSV file. Simply navigate to the class page and click on the "Import Students CSV" button. You will be directed to a page that prompts you to upload a CSV file. You can either drag the CSV file and drop it on the dotted area, or click on the area and select the CSV file from your computer. After selecting and uploading the CSV file through either method, a screen will pop up for you to select which column header from your CSV file (regardless of the name and order) corresponds to the students' first name, last name, or email address. After confirming this, you will be redirected to the class page and the students should be added without you having to refresh the page. Depending on the size of your CSV file, it might take some time for the students to be added to the class, so give it some time.

### Delete Students

You can either delete a single student by clicking the "Delete" button on the right of the student in the students table that is shown in the class page.

### Delete All Students

You can delete all the students in your class by clicking the "Delete All Students" button in your class page.
