## Email Report Cards

Once you have finished grading your students and checking them in the overview tab in the report card page, you can email all of the report cards to the students by clicking on the "Email Report Cards" button and confirm the operation.

## Report Card Overview

In the "Overview" tab of the report card page, you will see 3 stats that show you the number of students you haven't started grading, have completed grading, or are in the process of grading. Under those stats, you have the full table of the students and their grades corresponding to each criterion.

## General Comment

The general comment is a comment that is in the report card and is the same for all of the students. You can use this to note common insights about the whole class in general, instructions, or any other message you want to deliver to all the students together. 

To write the general comment for the report card, go to the report card page and switch to the "General Comment" tab and click on the "Write General Comment" button, write the comment, and click "Save General Comment"
