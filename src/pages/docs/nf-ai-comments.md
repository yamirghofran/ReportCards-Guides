description: New Feature - AI Report Card Comments

With this new feature, when writing a comment for students, in "Comment Topic" criteria, you can choose a sentiment (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive) and artificial intelligence will write a comment for the student based on the sentiment and based on the criterion description. Therefore, to get the most out of this feauture, it's best to write the criterion description with the most detail.
