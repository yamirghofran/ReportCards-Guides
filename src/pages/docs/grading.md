## Overview

To start grading students, navigate to the report card page and switch to the "Grade Students Tab". On the left, you will se a list of the students in the report card with a colored dot on the left side of their name, corresponding to the student's grading progress. To grade a student, you can simply click on the student's name. At first you will see an overview of the student's grades. To start grading the student, you can click on the "Grade" button and start grading the criteria one by one. On the bottom of each the grading input, you will see a "Next Criterion" button to save the grade and jump to the next criterion for the same student. Once you reach the last criterion for that student, there will instead be a "Next Student" button that will save the grade and jump to the next student.

## Grading Criteria

### Quantitative Criterion

When grading a quantitative criterion, if you have set up parameters in the criterion configuration, after you enter the numerical grade, you can click the "Generate Comment" button. After a few seconds, the artificial intelligence will write a comment based on the numerical grade and the descriptors that correspond to the parameter that the grade falls within. Therefore, the more detailed you write the criterion description and parameter descriptors, the better comment the artificial intelligence will write. Of course, you can later edit the comment that was written by the A.I, or generate a new one.

You also have the option to just enter the numerical grade without generating or writing a comment.

### Qualitative Criterion

To grade qualitative criteria, simply enter a letter or word and submit it.

### Comment Topic Criterion

When grading a comment topic criterion, you can either write the entire comment from scratch yourself or you can use help from the artificial intelligence. For this, click on the "Get AI Suggestions" button and select a sentiment from these choices (very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) and click the "Generate Comment" button. After a few seconds, the A.I. will write a comment for the selected student based on the criterion name, description, and the selected sentiment. Therefore, you will get more detailed and better quailty comments from the A.I. if you write a more detailed description.
