description: New Feature - Additional Emails for Students

From now on, you can add multiple additional emails to each student that will receive the report cards when you email them (parents, advisors, etc.).

## Adding a Student Manually
To add additional emails when creating a student manually, write each additional email in the dedicated field, separating each email with a comma.

## Importing Students from a CSV file
To use additional emails when importing bulk students by uploading a csv file, simply add a column for additional emails in your database and separate each email with a hyphen ('-').
