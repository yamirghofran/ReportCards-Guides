The first step when starting to use ReportCards.ai is creating and configuring the subjects that you teach. In this part, you can also add criteria to your subjects which you will later use to grade your students.

---

## Creating a New Subject

You can create a new subject by navigating to the "Subjects" tab in the sidebar on the left, and clicking the "New Subject" button.

### Name

This is the name of the subject like "Mathematics" or "Physics". 

If you want to use ReportCards.ai for grading and commenting individual assignments, this would be the name of the assignment.

---

## Editing an Existing Subject

To edit a subject that you have already created, navigate to the subject you want to edit and click on the pencil icon next to the subject name. This should enable to enter the new subject name and save it by clicking on the check icon.

---

## Deleting an Existing Subject
To delete a subject that you have already created, navigate to the subject you want to delete and click on the trash can icon. This will prompt a confirmation button for you to confirm if you want to delete the subject. You can then delete the subject by clicking on the red "Delete" button.

{% callout type="warning" title="Not Reversible" %} Once you delete a subject, you can't restore it. All classes and report cards that relate to the deleted subject will also be deleted. Therefore, be careful about deleting a subject. {% /callout %}

## Adding a New Criterion

Here, you can add a criterion to your subject that you will use later to grade or provide feedback to your students.

To add a criterion, navigate to the "Subjects" tab in the sidebar on the left and click on the subject that you want to add the criterion to. On the subject page, simply click on the "New Criterion" button and enter the criterion information that you want to create.

### Name

This is the name of the subject like "Mathematics" or "Physics". 

If you want to use ReportCards.ai for grading and commenting individual assignments, this would be the name of the assignment.

The artificial intelligence will partly base their comments on the subject or assignment name when writing comments in the "Grading" section.

### Description

Here, you can describe what your criterion means and different aspects that relate to this criterion in detail. This description will be included in students' report cards so they know what their grades or feedback relate to.

If you plan to use features including artificial intelligence, make sure to write the criterion description in as much detail as you can. The A.I. will base its comments very heavily on the criterion description, and also the criterion name.

### Criterion Type

There are 3 types of criteria that you can create for your subjects: Quantitative, Qualitative, and Comment Topic.

#### Quantitative Criterion

Quantitative criteria are criteria that you will grade by entering a number. If you add parameters to your quantitative criterion, when grading it, you can use the artificial intelligence to generate a comment based on the numerical grade you enter and the descriptor of the corresponding parameter to that numerical grade. You can also only enter a numerical grade, without generating or writing a comment (for more info, check out the grading section of this guide).

To create a quantitative criterion, simply write the name of the criterion, the description, and select "Quantitative" in the dropdown menu for criterion type. Be as detailed and thorough as possible when writing the description to get better comment suggestions from the artificial intelligence when grading students.

After selecting "Quantitative" for the criterion type, an "Add Parameter" button will appear. By clicking this button, you can add parameters to your quantitative criterion. For each parameter, you can provide a minimum and maximum value to determine a range of grades. Then, you can write descriptors for that grade range in the text input on the right. When grading this criterion, the artificial intelligence will write a comment for the student based on the descriptors you wrote in the parameter that corresponds to the numerical grade you enter for the student. Therefore, it's very important to write the descriptors in detail.

#### Qualitative Criterion

You can use qualitative criteria to grade students with a letter or a word such as "Consistent" or "Satisfactory" when the criterion can't be quantified with a number.

#### Comment Topic Criterion

You can use a comment topic criterion to write extensive feedback, in a paragraph or more, regarding a criterion for the student. This would be used in criteria that need more explanation and detailed feedback such as suggestions. To avoid writing a comment for every student from scratch, you can also get help from the artificial intelligence to write a comment based on the criterion name, description, and a sentiment (e.g. very positive) that you choose when grading that criterion for the student.

More information regarding the A.I. in the grading section of this guide.

## Editing a Criterion

To edit a criterion, simply hover your mouse on the criterion that you want to edit and click the pencil icon that appears on the left side of the criterion name. At this point, you can edit the criterion name, description, type, and the parameters if you have selected the criterion type to be quantitative.
