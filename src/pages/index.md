## Overview

Here, you will read an overview about how the app works in general.

### Order of Operations

1. The first thing you have to do after creating an account and logging in to ReportCards.ai is creating the subjects that you teach. When creating each subject, you have to also create the criteria that you will use to grade and provide feedback to your students in that subject. (More info about this in the Subjects section of this guide).

2. After creating your subjects and adding the criteria for each of them, it's time to create the classes that you teach. To create a class, you have to select which subject you teach to that class. You can teach a different subject to the same class, so you can have 2 classes with the same name but a different subject. This will determine the criteria by which you later grade that class.

3. After creating your classes, it's time to add students to them. You can either create students manually one by one, or import all of your students for a class via uploading a CSV file that contains the students' first name, last name, and email address. (More info about this in the Classes section of this guide).

4.  After adding all the students to your class(es), you can create your first report card for each class. You can name the report card anything you want (e.g. Semester 1 2023 or History Test 1 if you want to grade an individual assignment or exam).

5. After creating the report card, it's time to grade the students in that report card. (More info in the Grading section of this guide.)

6. Finally, after grading all the students in the report card, you can email the report cards to all students in that class.


## Different Ways to use ReportCards.ai

You can use ReportCards.ai in any way you wish any time you have to provide some feedback to your students. However, there are 2 main ways teachers use ReportCards.ai: Report Cards and Individual Assignments.

### Report Cards

Using ReportCards.ai for report cards is the main usage, surprise surprise. There isn't any mistery. You create your subjects, classes, report cards, and send them.

### Individual assignments

A complimentary way of using ReportCards.ai is for grading individual assignments, instead of entire report cards. To use ReportCards.ai for individual assignments, the only thing you have to do is to put the assignment name for the subject name and the report card name. The rest is basically the same and accomplishes your goal of using ReportCards.ai for individual assignments.
